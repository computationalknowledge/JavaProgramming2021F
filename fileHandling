In computers starting from the 1970s we have magnetic hard drives. The way information is encoded on your hard drive is in the form of something called files.

There is a level of organization called the directory system.

There are some small variations between Windows and Unix/LINUX but what I’m about to say applies to any computer you’re going to work with.  Mac OS is Unix.

In Windows the root volume of your file system is the C drive.

Best Work Practice when doing programming:

Use cd \  

Cd  <space>  backslash  : takes you to the “root” of the C: drive volum

This will take you to the “root” highest level 


Mkdir classwork



Cd classwork

Your command prompt should now reflect that you are in C:\classwork
